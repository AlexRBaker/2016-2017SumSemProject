#2016-2017 Summer Project
This encapuslates my project work for the 2016-2017 summer with Dr Yengo-Dimbou in Prof. Peter Visscher's lab.
The project comes in a few stages. The first is motif discovery near single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
The second has to do with clustering SNPs and using these clusters to investigate genetic variance.

The project is arrange to have Datasets which are public and private. Only the public datasets are committed.
Analyses contains the R code used to process data and some of the output.
GeneralScripts are just any widely used scripts which I end up using in multiple aspects of the project.
